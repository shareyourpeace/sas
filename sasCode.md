- The integrity of the research is dependent upon the integrity of the data.

- Within the context of a multi-faceted project at The Channing Laboratory, and including my own prior
epidemiological research, I used SAS. Among other things, I began with fundamental assignment of definable
variables and preparation of datasets - but continued in determination of appropriate models and the coding
required to find associations of interest; then subsequently, segmenting code for time and space efficiency when
looking closer at potential associations. This provided me with the opportunity to support researchers in performing computational analysis.

- Compilation and use of observational data from different sources requires attention to detail avoiding both
inadvertent repetition of data and the exclusion of important information. I am comfortable using the method of
electronic capture of data and the software to manage this information.

- Continued collaboration, evaluation, and personal research lead me to optional or tangential analysis as I
worked with the primary investigator to determine next steps in analysis and potential algorithms.

- My epidemiological research and experience provided me with the opportunity to prepare the results of our
data analysis for presentation in journal publications and our initial proposal for accepted funding.

- Working with the Nurse's Health Study cohorts allowed for experience and fluency in data-mining and
manipulation of the large-scale data sets that were essential in my research. I pay attention to outliers.

- My experience and personality avails me to meet learning curves quickly and I enjoy the challenge - working
mostly on my own. I am very focused, yet able to recognize when asking a simple question, might save hours of
time.

- At times, I worked remotely and was efficient in the method of data updates, and colleague communication. I
updated the databases with new code and results.

- It is in my nature to work efficiently, accurately and with attention and proper time allocation to priorities.
Working with timelines and meeting expectations are qualifications that provide employers with confidence that
their colleagues are getting things done.

- I work conscientiously. I am meticulous about any information that I am responsible in providing and I am serious
about accurate data.

- I produce clear, concise and brief technical notes and reporting updates.
- 
- The information available is vast and developing. I read quickly but carefully. Identification of research
methods that are unique or of interest allows for options that may elucidate distinct or possibly missed associations with data. Conflation of research that stands out to me - the areas that may be of further interest or the areas of cross sections of theories - these concepts just arise and innately interest me. I believe that I am able to communicate or share points of elective considerations in a easy-going and diplomatic manner without intruding upon someone's important time. I love research.

- Referenced above, I enjoy self-learning, and research and I work well independently but 'I appreciate the
contributions and feedback generated at the team level' ! Without this factor, pieces of the puzzle may not be
filled in or things might not move forward as expected.

- I easily learn and assimilate to using new technical tools, and feel comfortable on different system platforms.
I am comfortable on both mac and pc platforms and have experience with the unix operating system and
relational databases.
